# Article II - Membership

**Section 2.1 - Eligibility** Membership as defined in Wyo. Stat. Title 17, Ch. 22 shall be voluntary and application open to any individual of at least 18 years of age whose purpose or presumed intent is to contribute, to build, and to use the services of [[DAO Name]] and is willing to accept the responsibilities and terms of membership. 

**Section 2.2 - Admission.** The membership of [[DAO Name]] applicants will be granted or denied by vote upon the submission of required information on a prescribed application form, paying any required application fee, and contributing to [[DAO Name]], if any, all as determined by the membership. The contribution requirement may be waived in whole or in part for persons of low income. [[DAO Name]] is a decentralized network of members and may admit or deny for any arbitrary purpose or lack of purpose.

All [[DAO Name]] governing members shall have their membership determined upon receipt of voting tokens secured on a public blockchain (“Cryptographic Units”, and such holders, “Members”) . Cryptographic Units are used for participating in and improving the governance of [[DAO Name]] via the Designated Smart Contract (defined herein) (such process, “Cryptographic Consensus”). Once the admission requirements are met a prospective Member may be put up to a vote of the full membership or similar process enabled by the Designated Smart Contract. [[DAO Name]] will consistently review, and if necessary, Members may make adjustments to the admission requirements based on their evolving needs and as registered in a successful vote through the Designated Smart Contract.

**Section 2.3 - Rights.** [[DAO Name]] Members shall utilize the “Designated Smart Contract” (a smart contract deployed to the Designated Blockchain at the Designated Blockchain Address) as the exclusive method of holding, allocating rights and obligations among the Members, and spending, or otherwise distributing any Tokens that are [[DAO Name]] Property, of minting and issuing Cryptographic Units and holding and recording votes among the Members. [[DAO Name]] may also utilize the Designated Smart Contract to administer and facilitate certain other arrangements and transactions involving [[DAO Name]], the Members and/or third parties.

[[DAO Name]] Members’ rights and responsibilities are controlled by the use of the Designated Smart Contact used to conduct its governance and [[DAO Name]] activities. Members will cast votes and carry out the decisions made on the Designated Smart Contract.  Cryptographic Units are held in Account Addresses, key paired wallets controlled by Members in a designated hexadecimal address (“Member Web3 Account”).

**Section 2.4 - Responsibilities.** Each member shall keep reasonably current in payment of any dues or membership fees and other financial obligations of membership. Each member shall notify [[DAO Name]] of an e-mail address or other acceptable communication channel by which the member may receive written or electronic materials required or permitted by this document or shall notify [[DAO Name]] that the member has no e-mail address and designate the mutually acceptable form of communication.

If you have received any Cryptographic Units or are otherwise a DAO Member, you consent and agree to become legally bound by this Agreement as both a [[DAO Name]] participant and more specifically a "[[DAO Name]] Member".

**Section 2.5 - Limitations.**  Status as a [[DAO Name]] Member does not (and shall not be deemed to) create, and the [[DAO Name]] does not (and shall not be deemed to) include, any authority, right or power on the part of a [[DAO Name]] Member to act as the agent, representative or attorney of or otherwise act on behalf of [[DAO Name]] or any other Member, to bind [[DAO Name]] or any other Member to any Contract or Liability or to convey any [[DAO Name]] Property or any asset, right or property owned or held by or on behalf of [[DAO Name]] or any Member. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Member shall be deemed the partner of [[DAO Name]] or any other Member. No Member shall state, purport, imply, hold out or represent to any person that such Member or any other Member has any such authority, right or power.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no Member shall be (or shall be deemed to be) liable for any liability of the [[DAO Name]] or any other Member. This shall not (and shall not be deemed to) create or imply any obligation of [[DAO Name]] or any Member to indemnify or compensate any Member from, or hold any Member harmless against, any Liabilities incurred by such DAO Member under any applicable law, in connection with the Member's participation in [[DAO Name]] or otherwise.

**Section 2.6 - Inactive status.** A member who falls from good standing may have their membership revoked or suspended through the vote of Cryptographic Units (each said action, a “Guild Kick/Member Removal”).  References herein to the rights and entitlements of members shall be understood to refer only to members in good standing.

**Section 2.7 - Access to information.** Members shall have access to information concerning operational and financial affairs via the treasury application of the organization.  Currently the [[DAO Name]] treasury can be viewed via Designated Smart Contract.  

**Section 2.8 - Settlement of disputes.** In any dispute between [[DAO Name]] and any of its members or former members which cannot be resolved through informal negotiation, it shall be the policy of [[DAO Name]] to prefer the use of mediation whereby an impartial mediator may facilitate negotiations between the parties and assist them in developing a mutually acceptable settlement. Neither party with a grievance against the other shall have recourse to litigation until the matter is submitted to mediation and attempted to be resolved in good faith.  All Members agree that there is a preference to settle disputes amongst members or between members and [[DAO Name]] via decentralized dispute mechanisms in smart contract protocols. 

**Section  2.9 - Transferability of Membership.** Membership rights and interests may not be transferred except by vote of [[DAO Name]] membership.  Any attempted transfer contrary to this section shall be wholly void and shall confer no rights on the intended transferee and shall be cause (though none is needed) to burn the Cryptographic Units through a Guild Kick member removal procedure.

**Section 2.10 - Withdrawal and Expulsion.** A member may withdraw at any time upon notice to [[DAO Name]] through a vote to burn their Cryptographic Units or mechanisms otherwise authorized in the Designated Smart Contract.  Said request will not be unreasonably denied and shall be deemed conclusively as the Member’s intent to withdraw from [[DAO Name]]. A member may be expelled by [[DAO Name]] through the Guild Kick procedure established in paragraph 2.6 of this document and adopted by the membership. Upon termination of membership, all rights and interests in [[DAO Name]] shall cease except for rights to redemption of capital pursuant to Article V below (if any).

**Section 3.4 - Notice.** The membership is responsible for monitoring votes of concern on the Designated Smart Contract.  Notice of votes can be set up by Cryptographic Units holders via the Designated Smart Contract.  Notices of meetings shall also be posted on [[DAO Name]]’s official media including the member information roster, but the inadvertent failure to do so shall not affect the validity of the meeting.
